## **Things I want to know more about**
-

## **How to use Random Module**
- import random to import 
- random.randint(0,10) = a random integer between the two paramters 
- random.choice() = will generate a random value from the sequence 
- shuffle = will shuffle the elements in list in place so they are in a random order
- random.randrange = will generate a randomly selected element from range


## **Food for Thought**
- Seems pretty useful to generate random numbers but random.choice() seems useful for a game of any kind.

## **What is Risk Analysis**
- The probability of any unwanted incident is defined as Risk 
- Risk analysis is the process of identifying the risks in applications or software that you built and prioritizing them to test.
- Known and unavoidable risks
  - Time that is allocated for testing
  - defect leakage due to the complexity or size of the app
  - urgency from stakeholders to deliver
  - incomplete requirements 
- How to elevate these
  - Conduct a risk assessment review 
  - put maximum resources to work on high risk issues
  - Setting up a risk assessment database for future use
  - identify and noticing the risk magnitude indicators of high med low
    - High - urgent and needs to be addressed 
    - Med - tolerable company may suffer financially but limited risk
    - Low - tolerable and no external exposure or financial loss
  - Three prospects of Risk assessment
    - Effect - to identify a thing and then determine impact
    - Cause - look at the existing problem and see what point is the most probable reason
    - Likelihood - probability that a requirement wont' be satisfied 
  - How to perform Risk Analysis
    - Searching the Risk
    - Analyzing the impact of each individual 
    - Measures of the risk identified

## **Test Coverage**
- You are doing enough testing when 
  - You rarely get bugs that escape into production, and
  - You are rarely hesitant to change some code for fear it will cause production bugs.
-
