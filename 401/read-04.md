## **Things I want to know more about**
-

## **Classes and Objects**
- Objects are teh encapsulation of variables and functions into a single entity
- They get those variables and functions from classes within
- Classes are a template to create objects
- to assign a class to an object is looks like myobjectx = MyClass()
- to access a variable in an object it would look like this myobjectx.variable
- You can have multiple objects that use the same class but each object can have independent copies of the variables
- to access a function within an object it looks like this myobjectx.function()
- __init__() is a function that is called when the class is being initiated. used for asigning values in a class
-

## **Thinking Recursively**
- The christmas example with the elfs really helped me understand this a bit more 
- A recursive function is a functioned defined in terms of itself via self-referential
- to maintain state during recursion you have two options:
  - Thread the state through each recursive call so that the current state is pare of the current call's execution 
  - Keep the state in global scope
  - A list is an example of a recursive data structure
  -

## **Pytest Fixtures and Coverage**
- Objects that contain data you want to share across tests are often called fixtures
- in pytest you can define fixtures using a combination of pytest.fixture decorator, along witha function definition.
