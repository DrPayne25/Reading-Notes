## **Tables**

## **Key Takeaways**
- The <table> element is used to add tables to a web page.
- A table is drawn out row by row. Each row is created with the <tr> element.
- Inside each row there are a number of cells represented by the <td> element (or <th> if it is a header).
- You can make cells of a table span more than one row or column using the rowspan and colspan attributes.
- For long tables you can split the table into a <thead>, <tbody>, and <tfoot>.

## **Functions, Methods, and Objects**


## **Key Takeaways**
- Functions allow you to group a set of related statements together that represent a single task.
- Functions can take parameters (informatiorJ required to do their job) and may return a value.
- An object is a series of variables and functions that represent something from the world around you.
- In an object, variables are known as properties of the object; functions are known as methods of the object.
- Web browsers implement objects that represent both the browser window and the document loaded into the browser window.
- JavaScript also has several built-in objects such as String, Number, Math, and Date. Their properties and methods offer functionality that help you write scripts.
- Arrays and objects can be used to create complex data sets (and both can contain the other).
