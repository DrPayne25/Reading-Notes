## **Food For Thought**
- Instantiating a Student Object
- this. refers to the object that will be created in a constructor function 
- .prototype think of as inherit

## **Tables**

## **Key Takeaways**
- The <table> element is used to add tables to a web page.
- A table is drawn out row by row. Each row is created with the <tr> element.
- Inside each row there are a number of cells represented by the <td> element (or <th> if it is a header).
- You can make cells of a table span more than one row or column using the rowspan and colspan attributes.
- For long tables you can split the table into a <thead>, <tbody>, and <tfoot>.

## **Functions, Methods, and Objects**
- JavaScript has five simple (or primitive) data types:
  1. String
  2. Number
  3. Boolean
  4.Undefined (a variable that has been declared, but
  no value has been assigned to it yet)
  5. Null (a variable with no value - it may have had
  one at some point, but no longer has a value)
- JavaScript also defines a complex data type:
  1. Object 
- An integer is a whole number(not a fraction).
- A real number is a number that can contain a fractional part.
- A floating point number is a real number that uses decimals to represent a fraction. The term floating point
refers to the decimal point.
- Scientific notation is a way of writing numbers that are too big or too small to be conveniently written in
decimal form. For example: 3,750,000,000 can be represented as 3.75 x109 or 3.75e+12.



## **Key Takeaways**
- Functions allow you to group a set of related statements together that represent a single task.
- Functions can take parameters (information required to do their job) and may return a value.
- An object is a series of variables and functions that represent something from the world around you.
- In an object, variables are known as properties of the object; functions are known as methods of the object.
- Web browsers implement objects that represent both the browser window and the document loaded into the browser window.
- JavaScript also has several built-in objects such as String, Number, Math, and Date. Their properties and methods offer functionality that help you write scripts.
- Arrays and objects can be used to create complex data sets (and both can contain the other).
