## **Object Literals**
-Like variables and named functions, properties and methods have a name and a value. In an object,
that name is called a key.
- CSS uses property names and values.
- HTML uses attribute names and values.
- Variables have a name and you can assign them a
value of a string, number, or Boolean.
- Arrays have a name and a group of values.(Each
item in an array is a name/value pair because it
has an index number and a value.)
- Named functions have a name and value that is a set of statements to run if the function is called.
-  Objects consist of a set of name/value pairs
(but the names are referred to as keys).

## **Document Object Model**

## **Key Takeaways**
- The browser represents the page using a DOM tree. 
- DOM trees have four types of nodes: document nodes,
element nodes, attribute nodes, and text nodes. 
- You can select element nodes by their id or class
attributes, by tag name, or using CSS selector syntax. 
- Whenever a DOM query can return more than one node, it will always return a Nodelist.
- From an element node, you can access and update its content using properties such as textContent and innerHTML or using DOM manipulation techniques.
- An element node can contain multiple text nodes and child elements that are siblings of each other.
- In older browsers, implementation of the DOM is inconsistent (and is a popular reason for using jQuery).
- Browsers offer tools for viewing the DOM tree.
