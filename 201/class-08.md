## **Key Takeaways**
- <div> elements are often used as containing elements to group together sections of a page.
- Browsers display pages in normal flow unless you specify relative, absolute, or fixed positioning.
- The float property moves content to the left or right of the page and can be used to create multi-column layouts. (Floated items require a defined width.)
- Pages can be fixed width or liquid (stretchy) layouts.
- Designers keep pages within 960-1000 pixels wide, and indicate what the site is about within the top 600 pixels (to demonstrate its relevance without scrolling).
- Grids help create professional and flexible designs. 
- CSS Frameworks provide rules for common tasks. 
- You can include multiple CSS files in one page.
