## **Debugging**

## **Key Takeaways**
- If you understand execution contexts (which have two stages) and stacks, you are more likely to find the error in your code.
- Debugging is the process of finding errors. It involves a process of deduction.
- The console helps narrow down the area in which the error is located, so you can try to find the exact error.
- JavaScript has 7 different types of errors. Each creates its own error object, which can tell you its line number and gives a description of the error.
- If you know that you may get an error, you can handle it gracefully using the try, catch, finally statements. Use them to give your users helpful feedback.
