## **Food For Thought**
- Text

---

## **Links**
- Links are created using the <a\> element.
- Users can click on anything between the opening <a\> tag and the closing </a\> tag
- When you link to a different website, the value of the href attribute will be the full web address for the site, which is known as an absolute URL
- When you are linking to other pages within the same site, you do not need to specify the domain name in the URL. You can use a shorthand known as a relative URL.
- URL stands for Uniform Resource Locator
- The top-level folder is known as the root folder 
- The relationship between files and folders on a website is described using the same terminology as a family tree
- The main homepage of a site written in HTML (and the homepages of each section in a child folder) is called index.html
- To create a link that starts up the user's email program and addresses an email to a specified email address, you use the <a\> element this time the value of the href attribute starts with mailto: and is followed by the email address you want the email to be sent to.
- <a href="http://www.imdb.com" target="_blank"\> If you want a link to open in a new window, you can use the target attribute on the opening <a\> tag.
- To link to an element that uses an id attribute you use the <a\> element again, but the value of the href attribute starts with the # symbol, followed by the value of the id attribute of the element you want to link to



## **Key Takeaways**
- Links are created using the <a\> element.
- The <a\> element uses the href attribute to indicate the page you are linking to.
- If you are linking to a page within your own site, it is best to use relative links rather than qualified URLs.
- You can create links to open email programs with an email address in the "to" field.
- You can use the id attribute to target elements within a page that can be linked to.

## **Layout**

## **Key Takeaways**
- <div> elements are often used as containing elements to group together sections of a page.
- Browsers display pages in normal flow unless you specify relative, absolute, or fixed positioning.
- The float property moves content to the left or right of the page and can be used to create multi-column layouts. (Floated items require a defined width.)
- Pages can be fixed width or liquid (stretchy) layouts.
- Designers keep pages within 960-1000 pixels wide, and indicate what the site is about within the top 600 pixels (to demonstrate its relevance without scrolling).
- Grids help create professional and flexible designs. 
- CSS Frameworks provide rules for common tasks. 
- You can include multiple CSS files in one page.

## **Functions, Methods, and Objects**
- Functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a specific task
- When you ask it to perform its task, it is known as calling the function
- Pieces of information passed to a function are known as parameters
- When you write a function and you expect it to provide you with an answer, the response is known as a return value
- You declare a function using the function keyword 
- Then you give it a name followed by parentheses 
- The statements that perform the task sit in a code block 
- Functions store the code required to perform a specific task 
- Once declared you can then execute all the statement between its curly braces with just one line know as calling the function
