## **HTML5 Storage**
HTML5 Storage is a way for web pages to store named key/value pairs Locally.

Pretty Much every latest web browser supports HTMl5 Storage

Access of the HTML5 storage is done through the localStorage object

HTML5 Storage is based on named key/value pairs. You store data based on a named key, then you can retrieve that data with the same key. The named key is a string. The data can be any type supported by JavaScript, including strings, Booleans, integers, or floats.

If you are storing and retrieving anything other than strings, you will need to use functions like parseInt() or parseFloat() to coerce your retrieved data into the expected JavaScript datatype.

5 megabytes” is how much storage space each origin gets by default.

“QUOTA_EXCEEDED_ERR” is the exception that will get thrown if you exceed your storage quota of 5 megabytes.

You cannot ask for more storage space
