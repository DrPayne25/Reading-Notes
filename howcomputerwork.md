# **Charlotte Computer how do you work**

## **Charlotte Computer shows off what she is**
+ Can a machine help with the intellectual work we do? I think the answer is yes
+ 4 Things that make a computer a computer
    1. Input
    2. Storage
    3. Processing
    4. Output
+ 20th century computer started using electronic parts would take up a room and would take hours to do a math problem
+ Started out as a calculator how funny
+ Input: Stuff that you tell a computer to do
+ Storage: Where the inputs are stored duh
+ Processing: takes the info from the storage and then sends that info out into an output once done
+ Output: This is what the computer gets after processing the input that is stored then processed 

## ** Charlotte Computer Prepares to use Binary & Data
+ Computers works in 1 & 0 bt very rarely do we use them in that way
+ Wires & Circuits carry all the information in a computer
+ Think of a single wire that has all the info flowing through it you can have it be on or off and pretty much anything else that has 2 options this is called a bit
+ More wires would gives you more bits and with more bits you could represent more complex info
+ ini the decimal number system numbers go 0-9
+ Binary has two digits 0 1 and can represent any number 
+ 9 = 1001 in binary because the math breaks down likes this (1x8\)+(0x4\)+(0x2\)+(1x1\) = 9
+ 32 wirers in binary could store 0 - 4 billion
+ Texts images and sound can also be represent with numbers
+ All the letters in the alphabet could be read as number 
+ Pixels tiny dots that make up pictures and images 
+ Vibrations can be represent as a wave form and then covered into a number and then you can use that number to computer sound through binary 
+ 1 & 0 and electrical circtus are the backbone of the above four things 

## **Charlotte Computer uses Circuits and logics**
+ Every input and output of a computer is a type of info that can be represented as a 1 or 0
