# **Alex Payne Bio:** A Reading-Notes Original

Hi my name is Alex and i'm learning to code! I currently work over at OfferUp as a System Admin but hope to move over to the dev side andwould love to become a machine learning engineer as the end goal. In my free time I love to play video games like hearthstone and God of War. If not in front of a computer screen you can find me tryng to catch up on sleep! ~~I also enjoy long walks on the beach and a good bottle of wine!~~ Wrong profile sorry haha. 

## **_Growth_ Mindset**

I think a growth mindset is a willingness to accept that you always have room to grow no matter. Thinking this way helps you grow from the eventual failures that will come up as you continue to develop. It also means accepting that you aren't always going to get it the first time but don't give up just because of that!

### ***How to keep my growth mindset***
1. Always continue to search for feedback from peers it never hurts to have someone look over how you do something
2. Approach obstacles that come up as challenges that will help me succeed in the future
3. Document the failures and what you did to improve   
~~4. This is a test for strikethrough~~

## **Professional Compentencies**

### **Strengths**
Customer Orientation - My current work role has brought the need for customer orientation to succeed at. I think a lot of times I use this strength too much to cover up for my lack of other skills but do believe it is one of my biggest strengths that I can leverage to chat with customers about what they ate actually looking for. 

**Adaptability** - This is one that I constantly see posted on my reviews its not one that I really see but have noticed many peers mention it. In my work life I leverage this by being able to do a lot of different task and then use that knowledge to work with the appropriate teams.

**Inclusivity** - I like to hear all thoughts on how to improve everyone has a different experience that can help your team and project improve. I leverage this by keeping all ideas on the table plus keeping a mindset that my answer isn't the only one that will work it has greatly helped in my work life.

### **Struggles**
**Curiosity** - I don’t have a huge desire to be inquisitive I hope to change this as these classes go on. I hope to challenge myself by forcing myself to be curious by looking at new ideas on how to code and continuing to want to learn. 

**Planning & Estimating** - This is one of my big work area’s of improvement I struggle with time management and it causes me to miss a lot of the little things I think improving this would help. I challenge myself currently in this area by doing a better time of writing down my weekly schedule to keep myself accountable and if I can't reach my estimate reaching out to the right stakeholders sooner rather than later. 

**Writing** - Simple I struggle to write not my strong suits but I want to improve. I currently work to improve this area by forcing myself to take assignments that force me tow write. I then try to utilize the folks that I know are good at writing to help me improve.

Thanks for anyone that takes the time to give any feedback or help out with this new experince! Now without further ado lets dive into coding and create a doc that I a website I can refer back to with useful information!
