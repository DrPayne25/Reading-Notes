# **Reading-Notes** An Alex Payne Original 

Hi my name is Alex and i'm learning to code! I currently work over at OfferUp as a System Admin but hope to move over to the dev side and would love to become a machine learning engineer as the end goal. In my free time I love to play video games like hearthstone and God of War. If not in front of a computer screen you can find me trying to catch up on sleep! ~~I also enjoy long walks on the beach and a good bottle of wine!~~ Wrong profile sorry haha. This Page will be the homepage for all my adventures(Reading Notes\) through the seas of CodeFellows! Below you will find the Table of Contents that will take you to each new chapter of the Alex Payne Saga!
