# Markdown An Alex Payne Reading-Notes Original

Hi my name is Alex and i'm learning to code! I currently work over at OfferUp as a System Admin but hope to move over to the dev side and then down the road and SRE role would be ideal. In my free time I love to play video games and sleep not always in that order. ~~I also enjoy long walks on the beach and a good bottle of wine!~~ Wrong profile sorry haha. 

## **Growth Mindset**

I think a growth mindset is a willingness to accept that you always have room to grow no matter. Thinking this way helps you grow from the eventual failures that will come up as you continue to develop. It also means accepting that you aren't always going to get it the first time but don't give up just because of that!

### _How to keep my growth mindset_
1. Always continue to search for feedback from peers it never hurts to have someone look over how you do something
2. Approach obstacles that come up as challenges that will help me succeed in the future
3. Document the failures and what you did to improve
~~4. This is a test for strikethrough~~
