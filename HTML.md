Git push just push to all not looking at tree’s while git push origin main push just your origin  
Get in the habit of always doing **git status** that will help you from doing what you did with Connor slow down to speed up  
Make code changes in VS Code  
Use your terminal to make changes to act commit push flow  
Slow down times in the videos that you want to to better see what Brad is doing  
You only clone once!!!! use push and pull to adjust the code in your local and GitHub  
Angled brackets in HTML denote **elements** Elements are made up of two tags an opening tag and a closing tag example written in the code if you inspect this line! Do that by right clicking on the page and hit inspect on Google Chrome<HTML></Html> < HTML > < /HTML > or remove the spaces in this when writing the code 
Each Element tells the browser something about the info inbetween tags
A file called index.html which is the homepage for the entire site

## **Who??**
*Knowing your target audience is important when designing and creating a website while worldwide appeal would be great your target audience is who most likely will interact with it*
Creating fictional visitors to the website will allow you to refer back to there needs when thinking about your audience 

### **Target Audience: Individuals**
- What is the age range of your target audience?  
- Will your site appeal to more women or men? What is the mix?  
- Which country do your visitors live in? 7 < 2 > 
- Do they live in urban or rural areas?  
- What is the average income of visitors?  
- What level of education do they have?  
- What is their marital or family status?  
- What is their occupation?  
- How many hours do they work per week?  
- How often do they use the web?  
- What kind of device do they use to access the web?  

### **Target Audience: Companies**
- What is the size of the company or relevant department? 
- What is the position of people in the company who visit your site? 
- Will visitors be using the site for themselves or for someone else? 
- How large is the budget they control? 

## **Why?**
*Once you figure out who is coming to the website now we get into the why are they visiting.*

Two Basic categories of questions you can ask to help determine why they are coming
### **Key motivations** 
- Is this for general entertainment or Do they have a specific need 
- Is there a goal personal or professional
- Is the time investment a essential need or a luxury

### **Specific Goals**
- Are they looking for vernal information such as background info on a topic or are they looking for something specific such as a certain fact 
- Is this a product that they are already familiar with or do they need an intro
- Are they coming for time sensitive information such as news or updates
- Are they looking to discover specific product or service to help them decide to buy or not
- Are you going to need to be contact info do they need to visit you in person 

## **What?** 
*What are your visitors trying to achieve?*

- Creating a list of all the reasons a person would visit your site can help you find out what they are trying to achieve
- Thinking about what a visitor will need to achieve what they are looking to do is the next key step 
- Remember you are working with human psychology here if someone doesn’t find what they need quickly or it is wrong info they will most likely look elsewhere
- Will visitors be familiar with your subject area / brand or do you need to introduce yourself? 
- Will they be familiar with the product / service / information you are covering or do they need background information on it? 
- What are the most important features of what you are offering? 
- What is special about what you offer that differentiates you from other sites that offer something similar? 
- Once people have achieved the goal that sent them to your site, are there common questions people ask about this subject area? 

### **How?**
*How often will people come to your site*

- Understanding how often people are to revisit a site will help you understand how often you need to update it if they are visiting it once every six months it may not be need to be updated as frequently as a website that someone is revisiting twice a day 7 days a week 
- Setting a schedule for these updates can be helpful to keep track instead of ad hoc 
- A site doesn’t need to be updated all at once or nothing some parts might not need and update as frequently 

### **Goods/Services**
- How often do the same people return to purchase from you? 
- How often is your stock updated or your service changed? 

### **Information**
- How often is the subject updated? 
- What percentage of your visitors would return for regular updates on the subject, compared with those who will just need the information once? 

## **Floorplans really???**

- Site Maps are basically another word to describe a layout of the site structure
- Card Sorting is a technique to help you figure out where information should go
- Asking your target audience about helping group related info they are using it 
- Site Maps start with a home page  
￼![SiteMaps](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81712870/114134400-8ce4a380-98bc-11eb-9791-da939cf9e8fb.png)
- Remember to focus on the goal a visitor is hoping to achieve if they can’t do that easily and intuitively they will most likely look elsewhere
- Remember you want to organize it in a way the reflect your target audience if it doesn't make sense to them but you are they going to use it? 

## **Wireframes**
Its a simple sketch of the key info on that needs to go on each page 

- Include info such as the logo, primary navigation, headings and main bodies of text, user logins 
- Don’t include info such as color scheme, font choices, backgrounds or images for the website 
- Remember this is a good way to have them focus on the site functions not the site look that can adjust much easier than site functions
![WireFrames](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81712870/114134414-9241ee00-98bc-11eb-89f6-b44df16887cb.png)

## **Message = Design**
*The primary aim of any kind of visual design is to communicate*

- By making parts of the page look distinct from surrounding content, designers draw attention to (or away from) those items. 
- Designers create something known as a visual hierarchy to help users focus on the key messages that will draw people's attention, and then guide them to subsequent messages. 
- Grouping together related content into blocks or chunks makes the page look simpler (and easier to understand). 

Visual Hierarchy
Most folks don’t read an entire website they skim through for the information that is important to them using visual hierarchy can help get your message across and help them find what they are looking for.

- Size  
![size](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81712870/114134447-9d951980-98bc-11eb-8ab9-1fb2ffc14855.png)
- Color

- Style

- Images

## **Navigation**

- Concise: Try to limit the number of options in a menu to no more than eight link 
- Clear: User should be able to guess what they are clicking on if it says dog photos but takes to cat photos is that clear
- Selective: Primary navigation should only reflect the sections or content of a site
- Context: Let a user know where they are in the website using color and visual markers 
- Interactive: Links should be big enough to click on and it should change when the user hovers over each item or clicks on it
- Consistent: Keep things the same your primary navigation should be the same everywhere not different on one page

# **Takeaways**
- Understand your who the target demo is, why are they coming, what are they looking for and when are they coming back 
- Site maps allow you to pan the layout of the site
- Wireframes help you organize the info that will go on each page
- Design is another form of communication. Visual Hierarchy helps visitors understand what you are trying to get across
- Size, color, and style help differentiate between pieces of info
- Grouping and similarity to help simplify what you are presenting with your audience

# **Takeaways**
- HTML pages are text documents.
- HTML uses tags (characters that sit inside angled brackets) to give the information they surround special meaning.
- Tags are often referred to as elements.
- Tags usually come in pairs. The opening tag denotes the start of a piece of content; the closing tag denotes the end.
- Opening tags can carry attributes, which tell us more about the content of that element.
- Attributes require a name and a value.
- To learn HTML you need to know what tags are available for you to use, what they do, and where they can go.
