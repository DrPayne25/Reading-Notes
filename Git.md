# **Git Who?:** An Alex Payne Reading-Notes Original

## **What is Git?**
What is Git?
Git is a Distributed Version Control System or DVCS for short that allows multiple users to access a mirrored repo allowing devs to colab on simultaneous workflows
Snapshots: Stores references of your previous works 
1. Its a version control system
2. It lets multiple devs work on the same code 
3. History of your changes to your file
4. Can view, apply, an remove those changes 
5. Keep all your files in one repo 

**Random Thoughts**  
Think of a **Commit = Save As** it basically saves the progress that was made  
Each commit is a snapshot that has a label that got to it  
Head = the label meaning your here  
Make sure to describe each commit not for me but for others that may work on it  
ACP = Add Commit Push

## **GitHub same same but different**
GitHub isn't a VCS like git but it is the website that helps dev mange and store code. It also helps with tracking of changes and allows devs to control who can edit what within their code.

# **Import or Clone that is the quesiton?**  
1.	Import use a existing directory into Git using terminal

2.	Clone the repo from an existing git repo basically copy and paste of the repo info to your local machine

## **Workflows?!?!?!!?**
There are 3 components to a git repo 
	1.	Working Directory: Where the files lives
	2.	Index: Place you stage commits
	3.	Head: Locates the most recent commit

## **Shortcuts you say**
git status: will show the status of your current file  
git add *: adds all files to be commited   
git add file naem: will add just that file to be commited  
git commit -m "": will commit that file with a note  
git commit -a: commits all files   
git stash: will store changes you are not ready to commit  
git stash: apply will retrieve this changes   
git push - will push back to your cloud reop   

## **The Cycle of Git**
1. git Status: Lets start by making sure everything is clear before we start trying to commit running git status does just this
2. git add: Next we will follow this up by telling git what files we are looking to add to be commited make sure you've saved or they won't show up
3. git commit: Now that we have the right files added we need to commit those to the repo use one of the above methods to pick all the adds or just specifc ones
4. git push: We ready to go live now folks time to push that back to GitHub and see what the live site looks like
