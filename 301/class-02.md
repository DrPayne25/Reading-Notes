## **Things I want to know more about**


---

## **React Lifecycle**
1. Based off the diagram, what happens first, the ‘render’ or the ‘componentDidMount’? render will come first based off the diagram.
2. What is the very first thing to happen in the lifecycle of React? The mounting phase when a component is being created and inserted into the DOM.
3. Put the following things in the order that they happen: componentDidMount, render, constructor, componentWillUnmount, React Updates: 
 + constructor
 + render
 + componentDidMount
 + React Updates? 
 + UNSAFE_componentWillMount
4. What does componentDidMount do? It signals that the component and all its sub-components have rendered properly.


## **React State Vs Props**
1. What types of things can you pass in the props? Pretty much anything it will basically be the argument for a function. It will also be data that isn't handled within the component. If its static data props would be good as well.
2. What is the big difference between props and state? Props you pass into a component state is handled within the component
3. When do we re-render our application? It will re-render when we change the state. 
4. What are some examples of things that we could store in state? 
   + You could store the current count for counter in state.
   + cart button on a website is probably as state as you add and remove items 
   + Nice for a form as well
