## **Things I want to know more about**

## **React Docs Forms**
1. **What is a ‘Controlled Component’?** It is a component that renders form elements and controls them by keepin the form data in the form data in the component's state.
2. **Should we wait to store the users responses from the form into state when they submit the form OR should we update the state with their responses as soon as they enter them? Why.** I believe we want to update the state with their responses as soon as they answer them because our event handler runs on every keystroke in the example. Which would then mean that its saving that value as they type. 
3. **How do we target what the user is entering if we have an event handler on an input field?** We would want to name attribute to each element and let the handler function choose what to do based on the value of event.target.name


## **Food for Thought**
.bind what does that do? 
Need to play around with this.
