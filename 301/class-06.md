## **Pair Programming**
1. What are the 6 reasons for pair programming?
   - Greater Efficiency
   - Engaged Collaboration
   - Learning from Fellow Students
   - Social Skills
   - Job Interview Readiness
   - Work Environment Readiness
2. In your experience, which of these reasons have you found most beneficial? Engaged Coolaboration and Learning from Fellow students. It really helps to have someone that is pushing you to finish something in my experience. I also love getting to see how other folks write code since i'm pretty basic lol. 
3. How does pair programming work? It works by having two dev code together where one is a driver(does everything on the computer relating to code) and a navigator(handles looking ahead helping with typos and researching info as the driver needs while being an extra set of eyes on the code). these two work together to write code.
