## **Things I want to know more about**
- What is a domain class and infrastructure class?
- Real life context/example for this bit abstract right now.

## **Component Based Architecture**
1. What is a component?
  + A component is a modular, portable, replaceable, and reusable set of well-defined functionality that encapsulates its implementation and exporting it as a higher-level interface.
  + A component is a software object, intended to interact with other components, encapsulating certain functionality or a set of functionalities. It has an obviously defined interface and conforms to a recommended behavior common to all components within an architecture.
2. What are the characteristics of a component?
  + Reusability − Components are usually designed to be reused in different situations in different applications. However, some components may be designed for a specific task.
  + Replaceable − Components may be freely substituted with other similar components.
  + Not context specific − Components are designed to operate in different environments and contexts.
  + Extensible − A component can be extended from existing components to provide new behavior.
  + Encapsulated − A A component depicts the interfaces, which allow the caller to use its functionality, and do not expose details of the internal processes or any internal variables or state.
  + Independent − Components are designed to have minimal dependencies on other components.
3. What are the advantages of using component based architecture?
   + Reduced time in market and the development cost by reusing existing components.
   + Increased reliability with the reuse of the existing components.

## **Food for Thought**
+ Models any dependencies from left to right and inheritance from top (base class) to bottom (derived classes)
+ Experienced designers consider all (or most) of the alternative design solutions before settling on the final design model

## **What is Props and How to Use it in React**
1. What is props short for?
   + Properties and is used for passing data from one component to another
2. How are props used in React?
  + Props are used to pass data from one component to another.
3. What is the flow of props? 
   + It is a uni-direction flow from parent to child.

## **Food for Thought**
+ Data with props are being passed in a uni-directional flow. (one way from parent to child)
+ Props data is read only and should not be changed by child components
+ To Call a component the call must start with a Capital letter.
