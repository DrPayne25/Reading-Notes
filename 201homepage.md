# **Alex Payne 201 Homepage:** A Reading-Notes 201 Original

This is my Homepage for my 201 Class it has links to all future sections as well as what a growth mindset is to me! 

## **_Growth_ Mindset**

I think a growth mindset is a willingness to accept that you always have room to grow no matter. Thinking this way helps you grow from the eventual failures that will come up as you continue to develop. It also means accepting that you aren't always going to get it the first time but don't give up just because of that!

### ***How to keep my growth mindset***
1. Always continue to search for feedback from peers it never hurts to have someone look over how you do something
2. Approach obstacles that come up as challenges that will help me succeed in the future
3. Document the failures and what you did to improve   
~~4. This is a test for strikethrough~~

## **Professional Competencies**

These have not changed since the 102 homepage so you can refer to [them](102homepage.md) for what my professional competencies are!

Thanks for anyone that takes the time to give any feedback or help out with this new experience! Now without further ado lets dive into coding and create a website I can refer back to with useful information!
