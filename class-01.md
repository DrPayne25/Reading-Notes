## **Structure**

### **Key Takeaways**
1. An HTML Page is just one big text document looks at the inspect tool if you don't believe me
2. Tags are used in HTML to give the characters inside angled brackets the special meaning for instance a <p\> will be used to note this is the paragraph section </p\> is used to end that 
3. Tags are often referred to as elements
4. Tags often come in pairs generally an opening tag to tag the start and a closing tag to tag the end
5. An opening tag can carry an attribute which can give more content to that element
6. Attributes require a name and a value 
7. Tags are very important in HTML knowing which ones are available and what what they do and where they go
